  <section id="goals">
    <h1>Our Goals</h1>
    <p>As a robotics team in the FTC, our primary goal is to foster a passion for STEM through hands-on learning and collaboration. We aim to design, build, and program innovative robots that can tackle complex challenges while promoting teamwork and problem-solving skills. Additionally, we strive to inspire in the field of engineering, encouraging people to explore their interests in technology and engineering. Together, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of our creativity and technical abilities.</p>

    <h1>Our Meeting Timings</h1>
    <p>We have meetings 3 days a week and around 2 hours each time. Each time we strive to be the best and most productive we can be whilst being casual with each other. Our routine is normally finding what jobs we are needed and where then split off into one to three groups and then working like separate teams which allow us to be more productive and efficient because since one group is related to another person in that groups job, they can relay fast and make it easier on each other.</p>

    <h1>The Meetings</h1>
    <p>Our team strives for efficiency, productivity, and fun in every meeting. We break into smaller groups based on expertise, such as website development, technology, and engineering, to focus on our strengths and work effectively.

In the Technology team, we use music—like classical tunes—to stay focused while updating slides, improving documentation, and enhancing our website. Coordination and concentration within the team help us achieve our goals.

The Engineering team works similarly but focuses more on specific project aspects. Small groups tackle different tasks, such as perfecting the drivetrain, designing the arm, or testing the claw. Regular communication and collaboration help us troubleshoot and make progress.

This structure fosters a supportive and productive environment, where everyone’s contributions are valued. Celebrating achievements and learning from challenges keeps us motivated and improves our work.

By combining hard work, collaboration, and fun, we strengthen our team and tackle complex projects effectively, ensuring we stay at the forefront of our field. Our focus on continuous improvement helps us build great things together.</p>
